Which xxx is the best? Which xxx do you recommend? Do you think what&amp;rsquo;s the best xxx of 2021? xxx here can be substituted by any type of screenplays, i.e. movies, TV series, TV show and etc. This rule applies to one type of screenplays as well - TV anime.
In this post, I would present my analysis on what&amp;rsquo;s most welcomed TV animes in different period of time and what are the potential features make them become popular among viewers, with the help the data from anime community in Reddit and anime record data.</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://lianglouise.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lianglouise.github.io/about/</guid><description>I am a recent graduate from University of Toronto Scarborough.

It is about the implementation of &lt;a href="http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf" target="_blank">MapReduce&lt;/a>, a framework introduced by Google that can process huge volume of data parallelly by splitting a single task to multiple small ones and assigning them to a cluster of &amp;ldquo;cheap&amp;rdquo; machines. And by using this framework, also as mentioned in the paper, this lets programmer make use of distributed system without the need of experience of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A very classic use case of this framework is counting words in a large file, which is also what we are to implement.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Some Practice on Implementing Signal Protocol With Python (2): Double Ratchet</title><link>https://lianglouise.github.io/post/some_practice_on_implementing_signal_protocol_with_python_2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2020 23:13:55 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://lianglouise.github.io/post/some_practice_on_implementing_signal_protocol_with_python_2/</guid><description>&lt;p>After doing a handshake using X3DH, Both users can authenticate each other and agree on a shared master secret.&lt;/p>

Finally! At the end of 2019, I managed to launched my personal blog with the help of Hexo and archer theme. with the help of Hugo and Fuji theme.
I will share my naive thoughts and experiences on coding here. ðŸ˜œ
Hope you could find something helpful and interesting.</description></item></channel></rss>
