      <title>List in Pintos</title>

      <description>Pintos is a simple Linux OS for the course CS140. It&amp;rsquo;s designed to help understand some important functions of OS, including threads, virtual memory and file system. Though it&amp;rsquo;s very simple compared to the real linux kernel, it still can run an real x86 simulator.
This post is about an important data structure list in the src/lib/kernel/list.c, which is used massively in the pintos project. But its design usually made it easy to confuse the people at first, so it&amp;rsquo;s very interesting to look into its implementation.
Some Background Since Standard C doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide dynamic list library, it&amp;rsquo;s up to developers to decide how to implement the list when they need to use it.</description>
