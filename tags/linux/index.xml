As it&amp;rsquo;s going be a VM which requires almost no changes after it&amp;rsquo;s configured, I was hoping to minimize it as much as possible. The OS image I need to use is the Debian 12 image from the official Debian release repo.
The softwares I installed required some disk space around 2G, which is more than the original disk space the image initially configured, so I decided to extend the disk to allocate more space directly as I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to create an extra img file for this work.</description></item></channel></rss>
